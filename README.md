Epidemic analysis of COVID-19 in China by dynamical modeling  based on modified SEIR model
Traditional SEIR model would take Suspected Exposed Infectious and Recover crowd into account
In our model, new modifications would be needed to simulate government quarantiene and COVID-19's infection ability during the latent period
Thus we introduced new model based on Python language
It fits the epidemic in WuHan nicely.
